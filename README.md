## Tech Stack
- Xcode: Version 15.3
- Language: Swift 5.10

## Architecture
![VIPER](https://github.com/Alihizardere/denemess/assets/79551625/f747a9b3-0bb7-467a-a3c2-cafe6fea3935)

The VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) architecture is used for these fundamental reasons:
- **Separation of Concerns:** VIPER clearly separates the app into distinct components: View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. This makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component in VIPER has a specific role and responsibility. This ensures that each part of the application focuses on one aspect of the functionality, making the app easier to understand and manage.
- **Scalability:** VIPERâ€™s modular structure allows new features or changes to be easily integrated. This enhances the application's scalability and streamlines the development process.

### VIPER Components:
- **View:** Displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.
- **Interactor:** Contains the business logic and makes network or database calls.
- **Presenter:** Retrieves data from the Interactor and formats it for display by the View.
- **Entity:** Contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.
- **Router:** Handles navigation and passing data between screens.

Using VIPER helps in creating a clean, organized, and testable codebase, ensuring a better development experience and a more robust application.
